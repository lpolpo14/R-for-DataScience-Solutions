## Personal Solutions for the book R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

The solutions were written by me. For more complete and better solutions with proper explanation please visit the amazing site by Jeffrey B. Arnold and Contributors found [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).

The project is not finished for the time being - Solutions for chapter 13 and following parts are not provided due to lack of time and other projects I must focus on. The solutions for the finished chapters are mine. I must mention that I am not particularly happy for the solutions for chapter 3 since they require a lot of thinking that a data analyst does, while I mostly wanted to focus on learning the language - That may change in the future as I may revise it.

Thank you for reading.
